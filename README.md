yoloninja - A Nokia 6212 NFC cardreader and maybe more
=========

Developed as part of the exercises of the "(Mobile) Network Services and Applications" lecture at Vienna University of Technology (TU Vienna) by Michael Borkowski and Alexander Falb.

Native requirements
---------

Since (at this developement branch) the responsible serial communication library, NRJavaSerial, loads its native dependencies dynamically at runtime, no native pre-requisites for this project exist.
